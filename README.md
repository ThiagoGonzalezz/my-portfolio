# **Thiago's Portfolio – Software Developer** 🚀💡  

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that I developed during my studies at **Universidad Tecnológica Nacional, Facultad Regional Buenos Aires (UTN FRBA)**.  

These projects range from **individual work** to **collaborative efforts**, covering topics such as distributed systems, software architecture, testing frameworks, and database management.
