# Thiago's Portfolio ‚Äì Software Developer üöÄüí°

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is a collection of projects I developed as part of my studies at Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional, Facultad Regional Buenos Aires (UTN FRBA).  

Some of these projects were individual, while others were developed collaboratively as part of a team.

## üìå Projects  

<h3><a href="https://github.com/ThiagoGonzalezz/my-portfolio/tree/main/food-access-system">üçΩÔ∏è Food Access Management System</a></h3>  
A support system designed to improve food accessibility through a network of public refrigerators. It enables real-time monitoring of refrigerator statuses, donation tracking, and volunteer coordination to ensure efficient food distribution. The backend is developed in Java, using Javalin for API development and Hibernate for object-relational mapping. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive interface for users. We use MySQL as the database service, ensuring reliable data management.  
Additionally, we deployed the application using AWS, ensuring scalability and high availability.  
This project focuses on software architecture, API integration, and cloud deployment, providing a structured solution for food donation management.

üîß Technologies & Concepts: Java | Javalin | REST APIs | MVC | Broker | ORM (Hibernate) | Cloud Deployment (AWS).



<h3><a href="https://github.com/ThiagoGonzalezz/my-portfolio/tree/main/distributed-os-simulation">üñ•Ô∏è Distributed Operating System Simulation</a></h3> 
This project is a distributed system simulator designed to manage process scheduling, memory administration, and file system operations. It consists of multiple interconnected modules: the Kernel, responsible for process execution and scheduling; the CPU module, which simulates the instruction cycle including fetch, decode, execute, and interrupt handling; the Memory module, managing paging, virtual memory, and process memory allocation; and the I/O interface, which handles input/output operations and implements a simplified file system (DialFS).
Developed in C, the system features socket-based interprocess communication, multithreading for concurrency, and various scheduling algorithms such as FIFO, Round Robin, and Virtual Round Robin (VRR). Additionally, it incorporates resource synchronization mechanisms and structured logging to facilitate debugging and evaluation. This project showcases expertise in low-level programming, systems architecture, and operating system concepts, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.

üîß Technologies & Concepts: C | Sockets | Multithreading | Process Scheduling | Memory Management | File System (DialFS) | Logging & Configuration



<h3><a href="https://github.com/ThiagoGonzalezz/my-portfolio/tree/main/ruby-testing-framework">üß™ TADsPec - Ruby Testing Framework</a></h3>  
A custom testing framework built in Ruby, designed to provide an expressive and extensible DSL for assertions, enabling clean and readable test definitions. The framework leverages metaprogramming to support dynamic test generation, assertion handling, and mocking & spying mechanisms for unit testing.
The framework introduces a "deberia" assertion system, allowing intuitive syntax for equality, range comparisons, attribute validation, method existence checking, and error handling. It also includes test suites, enabling structured test execution with detailed reporting on passed, failed, and crashed tests. Additionally, it supports mocking for method overriding within test scopes and spies to track method calls and arguments.
Developed with Ruby‚Äôs metaprogramming capabilities, this project showcases expertise in DSL design, dynamic method resolution, and automated testing strategies.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/ThiagoGonzalezz/my-portfolio/tree/main/parser-combinators-%26-image-processing">üé® Parser Combinators & Image Processing</a></h3>  
This project implements a parser combinator framework in a hybrid object-functional approach, designed to process a domain-specific language (DSL) for image description. The system parses structured text into an abstract syntax tree (AST), applies optimizations, and ultimately interprets the tree to generate visual representations using a provided graphics API.
The implementation includes primitive parsers for basic tokens like characters, numbers, and strings, as well as combinators that allow composing complex parsing rules. Using functional programming principles, the parser features immutability, pattern matching, higher-order functions, and strong type safety. Once parsed, images can be transformed with scaling, rotation, translation, and color adjustments, and redundant transformations are simplified for efficiency.
The final interpreter renders the parsed images to the screen, files, or an interactive interface, demonstrating expertise in parser combinators, AST transformations, and functional programming concepts.

üîß Technologies & Concepts: Scala | Parser Combinators | Functional Programming | AST Manipulation | DSL Design | Graphics Rendering



<h3><a href="https://github.com/ThiagoGonzalezz/my-portfolio/tree/main/marketplace-db-system">üõí Marketplace Data Management System</a></h3>  
üõí Marketplace Data Management System
A database-driven system designed to manage an online marketplace, handling product listings, sales, payments, shipments, and invoicing. The project involves data migration, transforming an unstructured dataset into a normalized relational model and implementing a Business Intelligence (BI) layer for decision-making.
The system is built on SQL Server 2019, utilizing stored procedures, triggers, and indexing strategies to ensure data integrity and performance. The transactional model enables efficient record management, while the BI model provides analytical insights through pre-aggregated views and structured queries. Key insights include sales performance, customer behavior, revenue distribution, and delivery efficiency.
This project showcases expertise in database normalization, data migration, SQL optimization, and BI modeling, offering a robust foundation for scalable and efficient marketplace management.

üîß Technologies & Concepts: SQL Server | Data Normalization | T-SQL | Stored Procedures | BI Modeling | Query Optimization | Data Warehousing
